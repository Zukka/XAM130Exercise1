Exercise 1: Create a XAML-based calculator
This exercise will take an existing Xamarin.Forms application (a calculator app) and convert the user interface definition from C# to XAML.

You will start with an application that displays a calculator and allows you to perform simple calculations. 
In the starter solution, the UI is completely defined in C# as you have done up to this point. 
Our goal is to convert this UI into XAML. 
This is a standard Xamarin.Forms application with a Portable Class Library for the shared UI and logic, and platform-specific projects for iOS and Android.
